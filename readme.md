# what is cdn links?
     A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.


# what is cross origin?
      The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

   
# diff btwn npm and npx
        NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine.
        NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them.


# diff btwn ~ and ^
        ~version ‚ÄúApproximately equivalent to version‚Äù, will automatically update you to all future patch versions that are backwards-compatible, without incrementing the minor version. ~1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to < 1.3.0.

        ^version ‚ÄúCompatible with version‚Äù, will automatically update you to all future minor/patch versions that are backwards-compatible, without incrementing the major version. ^1.2.3 will use releases from 1.2.3 to < 2.0.0.

# for npm build - remove main from package.json

# def package.json
         configuration for npm

# def package-lock.json
          it maintains the exact version of all packages which installed

# what are folder not send to github
          the folder which are installed again not send to github like node_modules
          
# diff btwn git and github
           The key difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is a free, open source version control tool that developers install locally on their personal computers, while GitHub is a pay-for-use online service built to run Git in the cloud. Git is a piece of software. GitHub is an online SaaS service.

# def  parcel 
           Parcel is a zero-configuration bundler for web applications. It automatically bundles your code and its dependencies
 
# diff btwn normal dependies and dev dependies
            normal dependies are used in production
            dev dependies are used in development

# type=module
            This attribute is used to indicate that the script is a module. 
            JS Modules can only be loaded from a web server, so if you are merely opening the HTML file in your browser directly from your filesystem then the module file won‚Äôt load. The Live Server VSCode extension provides a web server for you so that you can run your HTML page through it and thus be able to load a module.

# JSX

 JSX  ~ [by babel(transpiles)] => React.createElement => react element (normal js object) [~ by (.render)]=> HTML  

 JSX => HTML like sintax

 JSX is not core react

 JSX = HTML + JAVASCRIPT

 in JSX more than one line code must use parenthesis()

 babel = compiler , transpiler

 we can do any javascript codes and expression on jsx by curlybraces{}

 while we use api call from {} ,jsx will sanitize the data comming from that api.


 # COMPONENTS

    - start a component name by capital letter  
    - we can use react element from component and vice versa

 2 TYPES
    - class component (old way)
    - functional component (new way)

# FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT
 
  - It is a normal javascript function that return some pieces of jsx
  - Call the function by three ways
    1.<call/>
    2.<call></call>
    3.{call()}


# COMPONENT COMPOSITION

  - call other components from a component (nested component)

# props
    - it is like argument
    - react bundles object in component ans passed to functional component as props

# configure driven ui
     - Config-driven UI is a technique that allows you to create dynamic and customizable UIs without hard coding them. 

# key in map
     - on using map function key must be used
     - coz when new items are added react got confused which properties belongs to which component
     - not using key <<<<< index <<<<< id 

# optional chaining ?.
     -The optional chaining (?.) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called using this operator is undefined or null, the expression short circuits and evaluates to undefined instead of throwing an error.

# 2 types of import
    normal import    -- export default component ;     --   import component from "path" ;
    name import      -- export const component = ;     --   import {component} from "path" ;


# hooks
     -normal javascript function
     -Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

# usestate()
      -const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
      -The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
      -State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.

# react fiber
      -React Fiber is an internal engine change geared to make React faster and smarter. The Fiber reconciler, which became the default reconciler for React 16 and above, is a complete rewrite of React‚Äôs reconciliation algorithm to solve some long-standing issues in React.

      - Because Fiber is asynchronous, React can:

       * Pause, resume, and restart rendering work on components as new updates come in
       * Reuse previously completed work and even abort it if not needed
       * Split work into chunks and prioritize tasks based on importance

# reconciliation
        -The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
        -React uses a technique called reconciliation to determine which components need to be updated when the state of the variable changes.

# diff algorithm
        -The diff algorithm is a technique used by React to determine which components need to be updated when  state changes
        -Diffing short for Differences Algorithm is used to differentiate the DOM Tree for efficient updates. React utilize diffing algorithm to identify the changes in the newly created virtual dom and previous version of dom after any changes are made.


# useEffect
        -The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.

        -Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.

        -useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

        -useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)

      *  useEffect(() => {
        //Runs on every render
        });

      *  useEffect(() => {
         //Runs only on the first render
        }, []);

      *  useEffect(() => {
         //Runs on the first render
         //And any time any dependency value changes
        }, [prop, state]);


# corcs
        -CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.

        -CORS allows resource requests from different origins, bypassing the Same Origin Policy.


# * whenever state variable changes react will rerender the component


# two types to load web
    - loads => api => render
    - loads => render => api => reRender   (it is best for user experience)

# * whenever writes on search text it will reRender the body component again  ü§Ø


# createBrowserRouter


# routerProvider


# Outlet


# Link


# useParams


# useRouterError


# 2 types of routing
   1.serverSide routing
   2.clientSide routing
